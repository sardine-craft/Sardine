<h2>What are sardines, and why do we like 'em?</h2>

<p>Sardines are small, salty fish that live in an oddly-shaped can. They sometimes like to take midnight walks around your house, or accidentally get stuck in your dreams. It's not their fault. Most of the time, you have to eat sardines in order for them to get stuck in your dreams. The reason why we like 'em is that for one, they're awesome. For two, when you eat 'em, you can eat 'em whole. And you don't even have to cook 'em! You just pop open their can and watch 'em stare at you with a blank, yet tantalizing, stare, untill you can't bear it any more, and you pop one, then two, then three, then the rest of the can in your mouth because they are just so <em>tasty</em>.</p>
